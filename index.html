pupusas.cc is a website with free public services run by two people.

here are the services we plan to host:

- jellyfin media server*
- email*
- matrix homeserver (synapse)

maybe in the later stages:

- minecraft server (java)
- temporary file storage (max 500mb, 7 days)

all services will be free to use, but we will accept donations for server costs in the later stages if you'd like to support what we do.

*for email and jellyfin you'll need to contact us to request an account.
